# Decent Newsroom

## Intro
Decentralised Newsroom is a platform for the creation, publishing, and discovery of mixed-media collaborative journals. 

Newsrooms used to be at the heart of journals and media houses, but they deteriorated when their business models started to fail. 
This project is a decentralised digital alternative. 

A lot of talented creators have found their opportunity in the handful of platforms available,
but there is synergy in collaboration that has been lost in the transition.

Let's bring back high-value professional journalism and collaborative publishing. 


## Constituent parts

This project has multiple facets that build on each other, making the whole more than the sum of its parts.

### Reader

A traditional newspaper lookalike made up of multiple individual journals. 
Logged-in users can pick and choose which journals they read and subscribe to, 
while passers-by can browse the default public ones.

### Article Editor

A content editor interface for writing essays, articles, and more. Featuring preview mode, saved drafts and personal notes. 

### Media Manager

In the current digital landscape, media content and written word have been driven apart, and it's time to bring them closer together again. 
The media manager is a place to create and share your own media library. 

### Marketplace

A marketplace for requesting custom-made media (photographs, graphics, data visualizations, animations, audio, video...), science review, contacts, etc. or 
for publishing art and stock images to make them available and discoverable to be included in the journals.

### Newsroom

A content management system for creating and updating journals and managing subscriptions. 

### Silk Search and Index DVM

An integrated service that provides on-demand indexing and search.

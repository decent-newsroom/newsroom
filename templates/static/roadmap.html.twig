    <h1>Roadmap: The Future of Decent Newsroom</h1>
    <p>We are building a decentralized, high-value journalism platform step by step. Each phase unlocks new features,
        empowering writers, publishers, and readers to engage with quality, independent reporting in a whole new way.</p>

    <div class="roadmap-section">
        <h2>v0.1.0 – <strong>Preprint</strong> <span class="badge badge__secondary"><small>Current</small></span></h2>
        <div class="milestone">
            <h3>A first glimpse into the future of journalism</h3>
            <p>This early version of Decent Newsroom is all about discovery. We’re launching a sample magazine
                to showcase what’s possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hand-curated, high-quality articles in magazine format</li>
                <li>Full-text search to find the stories that matter to you</li>
                <li>No content editor or user submissions yet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Preprint is just the beginning.</p>

        <h2>v0.3.0 – <strong>Newsstand</strong></h2>
